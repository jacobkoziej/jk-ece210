Oh no!  There's an imposter \textit{\textsc{Among Us}} \emoji{flushed-face}

Fortunately for us, we have the power of MATLAB on our side and can
\emph{calculate} millions of scenarios to see how likely we are to lose
to the imposter.  To make sure that we can find out our odds of survival
before the imposter kills us, we'll need to vectorize and use our newly
learned methods of indexing!

Since it's difficult to model crewmate and imposter behavior, we'll have
to make a few simplifications to ensure that we can complete our
simulation in time.  The rules for our simulation are as follows:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
	\item
		The imposter's \emph{sus} ability is the sum of two
		rolls of a two sided die.

	\item
		Each crewmate's \emph{sus resistance} is the roll of a
		four sided die.

	\item
		An imposter can kill a crewmate only if their sus ability is
		greater than the crewmate's sus resistance.

	\item
		There is one imposter, six crewmates, and twelve rounds.

	\item
		Each round, the imposter will target one crewmate at
		random.  If the crewmate has already been killed or has
		a greater sus resistance score, nothing happens.

	\item
		A loss occurs if one or fewer crewmates remain after the
		twelve rounds.
\end{itemize}
