It's time we abide by the Hippocratic Oath of Signal Processing%
\footnote{Do no harm to the signal.  Anything you do will harm the
signal.} and start to design filters.  Designing a filter may seem
daunting, but luckily for us, MATLAB provides us with easy-to-use
digital filter design tools,\footurl{https://www.mathworks.com/help/%
signal/filter-design.html} simplifying the process to nothing more than
calling functions with the appropriate arguments.

\section{Design Considerations}

As an engineer, it is your job to determine the appropriate trade-offs
when designing a filter for an application, as it really does come down
to using the \enquote{right} tool for the job.  For now, let's consider
only the following types of IIR filters:

\begin{longtable}{lll}
\toprule
Name & Passband & Stopband \\
\midrule
Butterworth  & Monotonic  & Monotonic \\
Chebyshev I  & Equiripple & Monotonic \\
Chebyshev II & Monotonic  & Equiripple \\
Elliptic     & Equiripple & Equiripple \\
\bottomrule
\\
\caption{IIR Filter Types}
\end{longtable}

Given the table above, we can select a filter type that will suit our
needs.  For example, we'd use a Butterworth filter in an audio
application as we often desire monotonic behavior.  After all, we
wouldn't want our filter to vary the attenuation of frequencies in our
passband and stopband, as that would sound awful.

Once we've decided on a filter type, we need to specify a few
properties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item
		Filter order

	\item
		Peak-to-peak passband ripple

	\item
		Stopband attenuation

	\item
		Passband/Stopband edge frequencies

	\item
		Size of the transition band
\end{itemize}
