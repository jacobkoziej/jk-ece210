Most times, when we use MATLAB, we're interested in performing numerical
calculations, but what if we wanted to determine analytic solutions to
problems?  To do this, we can utilize the Symbolic Math Toolbox%
\footurl{https://www.mathworks.com/products/symbolic.html} and turn
tedious math homework into a thing of the past!\footnote{Disclaimer!
I am not condoning robbing yourself of valuable practice!}

\section{Numerical Stability}

We know from MA~111 that we can define the natural logarithm like so:

\begin{equation}
	\ln(x)
	=
	\int^x_1
	\frac{1}{t}
	dt
\end{equation}

However, \(1 / t\) can become problematic when dealing with large
floating point values.  Consider what happens when we try to compute
\(\ln\left(1 \times 10^{32}\right)\) using this definition numerically:

\mCommandOutput{08-symbolic-math.d/numerical}

What we've run into is an issue with the \vocab{numerical stability} of
floating point values.  You'll quickly learn that many approaches to
solving a problem may result in numerical instability.  There are
typically a few ways of solving this issue: we can use fixed point
arithmetic that gives us the precision we need, use a different
numerical approximation, or use an analytic solution and evaluate it to
the precision we desire.
