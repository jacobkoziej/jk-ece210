At first, indexing in MATLAB seems like a trivial topic, and for the
most part, the basics will suffice for most \emph{basic} operations.
However, once you start trying to vectorize more complicated operations,
especially ones that rely on conditions, you'll quickly find yourself
limited in what you can calculate.

\section{Subscript Indexing}

For the remainder of this lesson, we'll be working with the following:
\begin{equation}
	\mat{x}
	=
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\mat{A}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 5 &  9 & 13 \\
		2 & 6 & 10 & 14 \\
		3 & 7 & 10 & 15 \\
		4 & 8 & 11 & 16 \\
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

We've already seen that we can access multiple elements of a vector by
indexing with another vector:

\mCommandOutput{03-indexing.d/seen}

But we can also write to these elements:

\mCommandOutput{03-indexing.d/write}

Matrices behave much the same as this behavior extends to each
dimension:

\mCommandOutput{03-indexing.d/matrix}

Say we want to select all elements of a dimension; we can use a bare
\mCommand{:} in place of \mCommand{1:end} to save us some typing:

\mCommandOutput{03-indexing.d/col}
