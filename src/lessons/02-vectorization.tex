\noindent
So far, what we've learned hasn't been all that useful.  Sure, we can
instantiate matrices, but we're here to make MATLAB work like a horse.
One of the fundamental principles behind \emph{clean \& efficient} code
is the vectorization of operations.  By vectorizing, our code appears
more like mathematical expressions found in textbooks, introduces fewer
opportunities for errors, and runs much faster as it can utilize
hardware vector operations!\footurl{https://www.mathworks.com/help/%
