One day, you may have the great fortune of implementing a digital filter
on an embedded device where you only have a few microseconds to filter
before the next sample.  In such a scenario, performing floating-point
operations is impractical due to how much slower they are to \vocab{%
Multiplyâ€“Accumulate (MAC)} operations.  To benefit from MAC operations,
we turn to fixed-point arithmetic, but in the process, we open Pandora's
box and must account for the substantial quantization erorr we've
introduced.  Luckily for us, MATLAB offers us a Fixed-Point Designer%
\footurl{https://www.mathworks.com/help/fixedpoint/index.html} for
optimizing and implementing fixed-point algorithms.
