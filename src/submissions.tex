To streamline grading, I ask you submit assignments as described below.
Please follow the submission guidelines, as I \underline{will not grade}
work that does not meet these expectations!

\section{File Header}

Since one day you might be a professional engineer, it's important to
give people who read your code some basic information about your work. A
file header can aid in this:

\begin{minted}{matlab}
% SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
%
% fib.m -- calculate the Nth Fibonacci number
% Copyright (C) 2025  Jacob Koziej <jacobkoziej@gmail.com>
\end{minted}

Notice the file name and short justification for the file's existence.
Also note the line with copyright information, but more importantly, a
contact email for desperate questions from junior engineers in a few
years.  Additionally, you can add licensing information if you plan to
share your code online.  If you're unsure about which license to choose,
I recommend checking out \url{https://choosealicense.com/} and then
finding the associated \href{https://spdx.org/licenses/}{\texttt{SPDX%
-License-Identifier}}.

\section{Code Normalization}

Normalize your code using \href{https://florianschanda.github.io/%
miss_hit/style_checker.html}{\texttt{mh\_style}}.  Doing so will ensure
a consistent style for code, making it easier to focus on the code
content over style.  There are instances where a code formatter's
decisions can make your code more difficult to read than a
non-standardized formatting approach.  In these rare cases, feel free to
add a MISS\_HIT pragma to ignore the line(s) in question.

\section{Printing Code}

Strangely enough, I would like paper submissions of your MATLAB code.
You can utilize the \mCommand[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/%
ref/publish.html]{publish()} function to generate a PDF with syntax
highlighting and evaluated code.
