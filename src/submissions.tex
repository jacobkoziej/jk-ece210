\noindent
To streamline grading, I ask you submit assignments as described below.
Please follow the submission guidelines, as I \underline{will not grade}
work that does not meet these expectations!

\section{Code Normalization}

Normalize your code using \href{https://florianschanda.github.io/%
miss_hit/style_checker.html}{\texttt{mh\_style}}.  Doing so will ensure
a consistent style for MATLAB code, making it easier to focus on the
code content over style.  There are instances where a code formatter's
decisions can make your code more difficult to read than a
non-standardized formatting approach.  In these rare cases, feel free to
add a MISS\_HIT pragma to ignore the line(s) in question.
